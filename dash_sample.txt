5.2 stat file

memory.stat file includes following statistics

# per-memory cgroup local status
cache          - # of bytes of page cache memory.
rss            - # of bytes of anonymous and swap cache memory (includes transparent hugepages).
rss_huge       - # of bytes of anonymous transparent hugepages.
mapped_file    - # of bytes of mapped file (includes tmpfs/shmem)
pgpgin         - # of charging events to the memory cgroup. The charging
                   event happens each time a page is accounted as either mapped
                   anon page(RSS) or cache page(Page Cache) to the cgroup.
pgpgout        - # of uncharging events to the memory cgroup. The uncharging
                   event happens each time a page is unaccounted from the cgroup.
swap           - # of bytes of swap usage
writeback      - # of bytes of file/anon cache that are queued for syncing to
                   disk.
inactive_anon  - # of bytes of anonymous and swap cache memory on inactive
                   LRU list.
active_anon    - # of bytes of anonymous and swap cache memory on active
                   LRU list.
inactive_file  - # of bytes of file-backed memory on inactive LRU list.
active_file    - # of bytes of file-backed memory on active LRU list.
unevictable    - # of bytes of memory that cannot be reclaimed (mlocked etc).

# status considering hierarchy (see memory.use_hierarchy settings)

hierarchical_memory_limit - # of bytes of memory limit with regard to hierarchy
            under which the memory cgroup is
hierarchical_memsw_limit - # of bytes of memory+swap limit with regard to
            hierarchy under which memory cgroup is.

total_<counter>       - # hierarchical version of <counter>, which in
            addition to the cgroup's own value includes the
            sum of all hierarchical children's values of
            <counter>, i.e. total_cache

user 13
system 5

user: Time spent by tasks of the cgroup in user mode.
system: Time spent by tasks of the cgroup in kernel mode.

user and system are in USER_HZ unit.
